# Easy-Farmer
•	Agriculture is the backbone of India’s economy, but day by day this sector is shrinking and people are moving out of it. This is because of several problems faced by farmers (like inadequate profit, lack of information about pesticides and fertilizers, advanced scientific method of cultivation and irrigation, etc.) still remain unsolved.

•	Hence, we have come up with an android application with a goal to empower farmers to work easier and smarter right from seed to yield till marketing, and thereby increase their profit.

•	This includes climate of cultivation, methods of irrigation to be followed, information about pesticides and fertilizers required for a crop, and the important steps to be taken while cultivation to get a profitable yield.

•	Current market rates of all the crop, and the best suitable crop for a particular land, based on soil and weather conditions is one of the highlighted features.
The Build:
•	Maintains a timeline on calendar of the events of cultivation process from beginning to end and suggests the farmer better actions to be performed to get a better yield.
•	Recommend the farmers regarding the start of cultivation and harvest period of crop selected, based on google weather forecast.
•	It takes the weather forecast from GOOGLE API and plans the events accordingly with respect to the crop and the soil.
•	A machine learning model is deployed which predicts the yield of the crop keeping in account the start date, soil type, weather conditions etc…
•	Suggests the correct fertilizers and pesticides to be used (which will also be included in the calendar of events) and also suggests the correct time to be used.
•	Calculates the approximate expenditure of the whole processes before starting the work.
•	Notifies the farmers about the market trends and the government announcements.
•	Provides a news feed which builds a co-operative famers community over the region.
Technology stack:
Android Studio – client side
Firebase – server side
Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Kera's) – For prediction of yield and expenditure
Requirements:
Dataset of estimated cost of cultivation with crop and soil type as feature (if available)
